      <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are required to use some Parol Lakay services. Parol Lakay and its ad management partners (“Ad Partners”) use cookies to record current session information.</p>

Web beacons enable our Ad Partners to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Website.</p>
